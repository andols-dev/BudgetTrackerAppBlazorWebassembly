# Budget Tracker App

## Project Overview

This is an ongoing project where I am building a **Budget Tracker App** using **Blazor WebAssembly**. The goal of this app is to allow users to track their income and expenses, manage their budgets, and visualize the remaining balance.
I have made expense and income classes and i have made the html structure for the app and and addes bootsrap.



### Features (Planned)
- **Add Income**: Users can add their income details such as the source and the amount.
- **Add Expense**: Users can add expenses, categorizing them by type and amount.
- **Track Remaining Balance**: The app will calculate and show the remaining balance after deducting expenses from the total income.
- **Display Lists**: Lists of all income and expense entries will be displayed with options to remove or edit them.
- **Toast Notifications**: The app will notify users when an income or expense is added, removed, or updated.
